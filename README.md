# Works only with the standard Elasticsearch >= 7.2

# DynamoDB --> Stream --> ElasticSearch

The missing blueprint for AWS Lambda, which reads stream from AWS DynamoDB and writes it to ElasticSearch.
Compatible with node 10.x. 

Whenever data is changed (modified, removed or inserted) in DynamoDB one can use AWS Lambda function to capture this change and update ElasticSearch machine immediately. Further reading:

## Getting Started

Install:
```javascript
npm i dynamodb-stream-elasticsearch 
```
Use it in your lambda:
```javascript

const {pushStream} = require("elasticcloud-dynamodb-stream")

const trans = async (obj) => {
    // do stuff with obj
    return obj
}

const ES_ARGS = {
  index: process.env.INDEX, 
  host: process.env.ES_ENDPOINT,
  transformFunction: trans, // OPTIONAL
  refresh: false
}

module.exports.toElastic = async (event, context) => {
    try {
      await pushStream({ event,  ...ES_ARGS})
    } catch(e) {
      console.log(e)
      throw e
    }
    return  `Successfully processed ${event.Records.length} records.`
}


```
